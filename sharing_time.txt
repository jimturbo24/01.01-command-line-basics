My given first name is James, but I prefer to be called Jimmy. I have lived in San Antonio since 1987, having gone to college and graduate school here in the city. I have an undergraduate and doctoral degree in biochemistry, and I love all topics that are science related. I am married and have two children, twin girls, that are almost two years old. In my free time, I enjoy cooking for my family and I exercise by playing a sport called wheelchair rugby. I joined the class to expedite my programming language learning process, having done some online tutorials that were helpful, but not as in depth as I liked. After the class I hope to apply my programming skills in a science related field, developing science based software, or in data analytics.
